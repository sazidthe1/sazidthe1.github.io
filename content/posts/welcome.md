This is Sazid, here's my story.

Finally have a portfolio, where you get to know about my story in one place.

For those who are new here, hi! I'm Sazid, a Data Analyst at MMC Asia. I have a background in various data-related roles within non-profit organizations.

I hail from Jashore, the oldest city in Bangladesh, situated in the South-Western part of the country. Here's a fun fact about me: I never dreamed of going to university, but fast forward four years, and I not only have a university degree but also have been working full-time in non-profits for the same duration. The place I come from is renowned for its date juice, flowers, agriculture, and industrious spirit, although it's far from being known for technology.`


Yeah, that's my story for today! Thanks so much for reading till this end! :)

Signing off,

Sazid
