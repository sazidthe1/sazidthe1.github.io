This is Sazid, here's my story.

Finally have my own portfolio, where you get to know everything about me in one place.

For those who are new here, hi! I'm Sazid, a Data Analyst currently working at MMC Asia. I have background in working various data-related roles within non-profit organizations.

I hail from Jashore, the oldest city in Bangladesh, situated in the South-Western part of the country. Here's a fun fact about me: I never dreamed of going to university, but fast forward 8 years, and I not only have a university degree but also have been working full-time in non-profits for the same duration. The place I come from is renowned for its date juice, flowers, agriculture (vegetables), and industries, although it's far from being known for technology.

`add more info for later`

That's my story for today. Thank you for reading till this end! :)

-- Signing off,

Sazid
