I'm an Information Management Professional at MMC - Asia and the Pacific, dedicated to providing independent and high-quality data, information, and analysis on mixed migration. I find joy in working with data that positively impacts peopleâ€™s lives. Currently, my focus is on `adding details later`. 

Also, I'm passionate about open source and knowledge-sharing, I strive to contribute to the community.

Outside of the tech world, you'll find me cycling, reading, and tuning into podcasts - currently hooked on [Huberman Lab](https://www.youtube.com/@hubermanlab). I believe in the power of data to drive positive change, and my goal is to make a meaningful impact in the field of mixed migration through my work at MMC.
