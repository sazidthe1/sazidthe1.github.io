      <description>This is Sazid, here&amp;rsquo;s my story.
Finally have my own portfolio, where you get to know everything about me in one place.
For those who are new here, hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Sazid, a Data Analyst currently working at MMC Asia. I have background in working various data-related roles within non-profit organizations.
I hail from Jashore, the oldest city in Bangladesh, situated in the South-Western part of the country. Here&amp;rsquo;s a fun fact about me: I never dreamed of going to university, but fast forward 8 years, and I not only have a university degree but also have been working full-time in non-profits for the same duration.</description>
